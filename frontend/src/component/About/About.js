            <span>Digital Bhojnalaya</span> is a food ordering website that allows
            users to surf the menu and choose the fooditems of their choice and
            place orders.
            <br />
            Now you can <b>skip the long queues</b> and order food with just a few
            clicks.
            <br />
            Once you place the order, its time to sit back and relax! The admin
            updates the order status for you to <b>track in real-time</b> and grab your
            order at the earliest.
